## Using Forestry as your CMS

This project is preconfigured to work with Forestry as a way to manage your content. Forestry makes changes by editing markdown or data files, uploading media to the correct directory and committing these updates to your repo directly.

Eleventy Duo has Forestry CMS pre-configured as standard. You can customize the configuration by editing `.forestry/settings.yml.`

Sign up for a free [Forestry](https://forestry.io) account

Import your repo as a new [Eleventy project](https://forestry.io/docs/quickstart/setup-site/#import-site-from-repo)

Once the site is imported in Forestry, go to settings/previews to start the preview server. You'll be able to preview the final rendering before publishing.

The basic CMS setup allows you to edit the following:

- Home page: Edit the content on your homepage.

- About page: Edit the content of your about page.

- Posts: Create and edit blog posts.

- Generic pages: Create generic pages that use a similar layout to posts.

- Global site data: Various bits of global site data such as your url, title, and other details.

You can add new blog posts, [data files](https://forestry.io/docs/editing/data-files/), or entire pages to fit your needs. You can also customize [how media is handled](https://forestry.io/docs/media/), by configurating gitLFS, Cloudinary, S3, or Netlify Large Media.

You can set up a [remote admin](https://forestry.io/docs/editing/remote-admin/) for content editors to log in directly to yoururl.com/admin to make content updates.

## Deployment

[Netlify](https://netlify.com) is a great way to easily deploy sites. There's no special setup you need to do with Forestry to deploy with Netlify. When Forestry makes commits to your repo, Netlify will auto-trigger a rebuild / deploy when new commits are made.

- Create a new site in Netlify and import your repository.

- Set the build command to `yarn build`

- Set the publish directory to `public`

## Built with
